<h2>Contact Information</h2>

  If you need to report a violation please inform any of the event staff or contact Sebastian Witalec at

<h2>The Quick Version</h2>
<p>
  Our hackathon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
  gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
  religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.

  We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at
  any hackathon venue, including hacks, talks, workshops, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants
  violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conferenceÂ at the discretion of the conference
  organisers.
</p>

<h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>
<p>
  Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
  orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images
  in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
  disruption of presentations or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
  <br />
  Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
  <br />
  As this is a hackathon, we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our hackathon are equally subject to the
  anti-harassment policy.
  <br />
  Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images,
  activities, or other material.
  <br />
  If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organisers may take any action they deem appropriate,
  including warning the offender or expulsion from the hackathon. We value your attendance.
  <br />
  If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a
  member of hackathon staff immediately.
  <br />
  Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide
  escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value
  your attendance.
  <br />
  We expect participants to follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues and hackathon-related social events.
